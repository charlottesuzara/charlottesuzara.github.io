Hello 

My interest lies at the intersection of adult education and AI-enhanced skills evaluation, recognition and training so that adult learners can access quality educational content that has longlasting effects on their professional lives, families, communities and the society at large. 

I have extensive work experience in the context of official minority language in provinces outside of Quebec in Canada. More specifically, I work in a non-profit promoting access to francophone programs for learners to learn in their first language and as an effort to maintain the canadian francophone cultural heritage that is being diluted in many provinces. I am lucky to be involved in projects aiming at maintaining Canadian cultural diversity. 

At the granular level, I love working with adult and youth learners. I have a passion for bringing people on their journey to learning about themselves and society, through AI-enhanced guided reflexions workshop. Discussions arising from these sessions have the potential to break down limiting thoughts and actions. 

Recently I was appointed as a board member of an advocacy network that aims at buidling capacity within francophone organisations and institutions in Canada. The advocacy group called RESDAC is have projects contributing to both economic and social aspects of the Canadian society. We are currently exploring AI tools to enhance even further our projects and impact.
